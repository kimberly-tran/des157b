        <p>From testing our paper prototypes, we learned that we might need to have some sort of pop up at the start of the game to give quick instructions; our testers didn’t know they were supposed to “tap” the mobile screen (but they said they think this would’ve been more obvious on an actual device). We also discovered that we need to think a little bit more about what menu options to have and where to place them (for example, what and how will we display information/options once the player wins or loses). Putting our ideas onto paper prototype screens also helped us see which screens we wanted to keep vertical or horizontal and how we might implement responsive design in the different screens. Overall it was also really enjoyable to test our prototypes with each other and to see how other people were bringing their ideas to life!</p>
