        <p>The topic I am thinking of working with is one of the community based ones, where data will be collected from community members and uploaded onto an interactive webpage for others to view. We had a lot of ideas in class about what type of responses to collect, from “reasons why I love Davis,” to complaint letters, to responses to the bricks surrounding the seal. I’m still thinking about which to do specifically, but I think it would be fun to create something that’s open to a larger range of people (maybe 14+). Currently I don’t have a partner in mind, as I’m not sure who else would be interested in a similar idea as me, but I’m open to finding one because I’m sure we’d be able to come up with an even better product and idea working together.</p>
        <p>For this project, I imagine having features for users to upload both messages and possibly images they want to share with the community (this could just images of them and the city of Davis, or could even relate back to other people’s scavenger hunt ideas!). I also envision some sort of thoughtful organization to be implemented to organize everyone’s messages, as this will become a growing repository for people’s memories that I hope people can enjoy visiting and revisiting time and time again (almost as if it was a physical place where you could go back and find your note/lock/etc., but virtually).</p>
        <p>I think I will have to further specify an audience once I am more certain on what type of information to collect. I think doing some more interviews and learning about what the people of Davis might want to share would be an important step to this. If the project isn’t engaging or clear enough, people might not understand the purpose or appeal of leaving messages there and not choose to engage with it, so I think that will be the biggest challenge.</p>
