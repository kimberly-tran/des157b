    <main>
        <p>From our usability testing we learned that,</p>

        <p><strong>Users showed confusion when the game switched from the map to the runner game.</strong> While players enjoyed the “surprise” and immersion of the game screens changing entirely, the immediate switch felt a bit too rushed. When asked about it afterwards, some people mentioned having some time to read instructions and press a button to start the game, rather than the game immediately starting. </p>

        <p><strong>Our game was generally engaging,</strong> and players gave a lot of positive feedback to the graphics and interactive elements on the page. People enjoyed the animations on the graphics and seemed happily surprised to use the keyboard to interact with the game. </p>

        <p><strong>We were also able to discover improvements for our visual design that would create clarity.</strong> When asked about potential improvements for visual design, people were unsure about the placement of the buttons; someone suggested having the instructions always visible on the lefthand side. The lack of contrast between certain parts of the seal image also made our communication of separate “locked” and “unlocked” levels unclear. </p>
    
        <p>Based on the feedback we received, we plan to add clearer instructions that pop-up immediately or stay visible on the page, rather than making fourth-graders locate and click to view this information. We also plan to rethink the layout and visual design in terms of colors to make our game more appealing to a younger audience. Lastly, we plan to refine the game’s interactions, as it’s currently pretty difficult to win, as well as finish adding the educational gallery items to engage and teach our audience about different Davis symbols.</p>
