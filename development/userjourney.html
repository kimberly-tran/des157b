        <p>From testing our user journey, we found that the transition we made from frames 1-4 to 5-6 was a bit confusing. We intended to illustrate the storyline changing from the person playing the game, to another scene where that person is then sharing the information they learned from the game with another person. Overall, it was fun to see our idea from a broader perspective and be able to imagine the storyline of an actual user. We also talked more generally about the concepts of our ideas and received a lot of helpful suggestions, such as making the levels in our game more interactive by having people actually go to the different areas to scan a new QR code for each level.</p>
