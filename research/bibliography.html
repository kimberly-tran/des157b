            <p>“Davis Centennial Seal.” City of Davis, 2021, <a href="https://www.cityofdavis.org/city-hall/city-manager-s-office/arts-culture/davis-centennial-seal">https://www.cityofdavis.org/city-hall/city-manager-s-office/arts-culture/davis-centennial-seal.</a></p>
            <p>This page on the background of the Davis Centennial Seal provides insight into the design concept of the seal, highlighting the themes of aspiration, community, cooperation, leadership, innovation, engagement, global citizenship, stewardship, vision, and optimism, that are represented throughout the seal. This article also delves into the details of the contents and meaning behind different parts/sections of the seal. I was able to better understand the makeup and organization of the seal, e.g. the inner ring telling the history of the area and land Davis is located, the panels tying the past, present, and future to the themes.</p>

            <p>Shelton, Susan. “Seals.” Home Page, 2021, <a href="https://susanshelton.com/Seals/Davis-Centennial-Seal">https://susanshelton.com/Seals/Davis-Centennial-Seal</a></p>
            <p>This breakdown of the Davis Centennial Seal on Susan Shelton’s website was useful in providing more detailed shots of the different sections of the seal. This was a helpful resource that allowed me to look more closely at the areas of the seals that have been talked about in class, and to analyze parts of the seal that Susan and others have shared stories about.</p>

            <p>Weitzel, Wendy. “Sealed and Delivered.” Davis Enterprise, 30 June 2021, <a href="https://www.davisenterprise.com/feature/features/sealed-and-delivered/">https://www.davisenterprise.com/feature/features/sealed-and-delivered/.</a></p>
            <p>This article offered details about the seals contents, creation, and vision. I observed how while Susan Shelton’s seal was at the center of this artwork, there was a lot of teamwork that went on with people from contractors to those who had more to say about the vision of the seal. The biggest takeaways I took away from this particular article was surrounding the vision for the Davis Centennial Seal. It is not only a celebratory gathering space, but also a project for education, as well as a piece for other community members to interact with.</p>
