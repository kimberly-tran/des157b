            <p>The design interface for the <a href="https://www.lettersanonymous.com/">Letters Anonymous</a> website was simple and generally clear. However, the text on the right hand side which act as buttons for the user to perform different actions aren’t super distinguishable as buttons. For the layout and design of messages, I thought it was a fun idea to make them look like actual envelopes. The interactions to hover over to reveal the name of who the letter is intended for before clicking in to read the whole letter was also pretty engaging.</p>

            <p>I thought the design interface used in <a href="https://theunsentproject.com/about">The Unsent Project</a> website was pretty engaging. The use of the large, animated letters works well to grab the users attention, and also contributes to the project’s overall narrative of “unsent text messages to first loves.” In terms of interaction design, there is not much the user can interact with. There’s a submit button in the top right hand corner for users to submit their own texts, but because the images are static I assume they won’t update immediately (the form isn’t currently accepting submissions so I couldn’t try it out myself. Changing the way the user interacts with the texts (being able to click to different areas, being able to expand texts, organizing texts by different colors, etc.) could make the user experience more engaging and enjoyable overall.</p>
